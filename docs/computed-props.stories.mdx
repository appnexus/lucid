# Computed Component Props

Any prop whose value is wholly derived from other component props is referred to as a _computed prop_.

## What are computed props?

A computed prop is passed into a component just like any other prop that is used for rendering.
The only difference that the a computed prop isn't normally passed explicitly since it can be entirely derived by the value of other component props.
The logic to compute these values is usually represented by a set of selector functions which map to each computed prop.

```jsx
{
  subTotal: ({cartItems}) => calcSubTotal(cartItems),
  totalPrice: ({cartItems, taxRate) => calcSubTotal(cartItems) * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

## When and why use computed props?

Computed props are useful when you want to separate view logic from data logic, or share common data logic across many components.
Using libraries like `reselect` increase component performance by ensuring that previously computed values are cached and reused.
Sometimes data that should be computed in the view end up being stored in app state which can result in stale app state being passed to components.
Using computed props can keep your app state lean and decrease the surface area for bugs in your app state.
Another reason is sometimes there's view logic that a parent component might want to know about.
Having these functions external to the component definition makes them easy to compose up as you compose your component hierarchy.

## How to define computed props?

In lucid, components with `selectors` defined use `buildHybridComponent` to get a component which applies those selector functions via `reselect` and passes them as props to the underlying component.

```jsx
import { stateManagement } = 'lucid-ui';
const { buildHybridComponent } = stateManagement;

const ShoppingCart = ({cartItems, taxRate, subTotal, totalPrice}) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {cartItems.map(({name, price, quantity}) => (
        <li key={name}>
          Name: {name}, price: {price}, Quantity: {quantity}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <section>
      Subtotal: {subTotal}
      Tax Rate: {taxRate}
      Total: {totalPrice}
    </section>
  );
};

const calcSubTotal = items =>
  items.reduce(subTotal, ({price, quantity}) => subTotal + (price * quantity), 0);

StatelessExpander.selectors = {
  subTotal: ({cartItems}) => calcSubTotal(cartItems),
  totalPrice: ({cartItems, taxRate) => calcSubTotal(cartItems) * (1 + taxRate);
}

const ComputedShoppingCart = buildHybridComponent(ShoppingCart);
export default ComputedShoppingCart;
```

Now that the component & selectors have been defined, `buildHybridComponent` returns a new component
which wraps the original component and passes it the computed values.

```jsx
<ComputedShoppingCart
	taxRate={0.0887}
	cartItems={[
		{ name: 'USB Charging Cable 6ft', price: 7.99, quantity: 2 },
		{ name: 'USB Wall Charger 12W', price: 6.99, quantity: 1 },
		{ name: 'Wired Earphones with Mic White', price: 17.99, quantity: 1 },
	]}
/>
```

But you still have the ability to take back control and compute new values for props by passing them in explicitly:

```jsx
const items = [
	{ name: 'USB Charging Cable 6ft', price: 7.99, quantity: 2 },
	{ name: 'USB Wall Charger 12W', price: 6.99, quantity: 1 },
	{ name: 'Wired Earphones with Mic White', price: 17.99, quantity: 1 },
];
const taxRate = 0.0887;
const shipping = 5.0;

<ComputedShoppingCart
	taxRate={taxRate}
	cartItems={items}
	totalPrice={calcSubTotal(items) * (1 + taxRate) + shipping}
/>;
```
