# Hybrid Components

Components which can be used as either stateful or stateless are referred to as _hybrid components_.

## What is it?

All hybrid components start out as simple stateless components at first.
Then a static property called `.reducers` is set on the stateless component and populated with state reducer functions that map to callback functions of the stateless component.
For example, a stateless expander component that calls `onToggle` to expand or collapse, might have a `reducers` property like this:

```jsx
StatelessExpander.reducers = {
	onToggle(state) {
		return {
			...state,
			isExpanded: !state.isExpanded,
		};
	},
};
```

With the `reducers` property set, calling `buildHybridComponent(StatelessExpander)` returns a stateful version of the component.
It doesn't modify the existing component, but rather returns a new one that maintains component state and renders the stateless component with that state as props.
The `defaultProps` of the stateless component are used as the initial state of the hybrid component.
Now that the component is a hybrid, you don't need to pass in every prop since the stateful wrapper will do this.
However, you always have the option to explicitly pass in a prop that always takes priority over the stateful value.
This way, you can keep control over component state that is important to your app and let the component manage more mundane state.
The most common example of this shared control between apps and component is with dropdown selectors:
Most apps don't want to explicitly manage whether the dropdown is expanded or not but controlling the currently selected option is essential.
In lucid, stateful components are exposed as hybrids by default, but all stateless versions are also made available to those who want total control.
You can even access the `reducers` property of the component and use them in your own apps and components.

## Why use it?

Most Apps have state they care about and state they don't care about.
Hybrid component allow apps to have as little or as much control over component state that they require.
Also, unit testing stateless components + reducer functions is much easier and simpler than trying to get full test coverage on a stateful component.

## How to create one?

Use the `buildHybridComponent` to create a stateful wrapper around a stateless component with reducers defined for each callback:

```jsx
import { stateManagement } = 'lucid-ui';
const { buildHybridComponent } = stateManagement;

const StatelessExpander = ({header, isExpanded, content, onToggle }) => {
  return (
    <section>
    <h1>{header}</h1>
    <button onClick={onToggle}>toggle</button>
      {isExpanded && (
        <div>
          {content}
        </div>
      )}
    </section>
  );
};

StatelessExpander.defaultProps = {
  isExpanded: true,
};

StatelessExpander.reducers = {
  onToggle: (state) => ({
    ...state,
    isExpanded: !state.isExpanded,
  })
}

const HybridExpander = buildHybridComponent(StatelessExpander);
export default HybridExpander;
```

Now you have the flexibility to either let the component handle it's own state:

```jsx
<HybridExpander
	header='Fully Stateful'
	content='The stateful wrapper keeps track of all state as defined by initial defaultProps and reducer functions.'
/>
```

...or take control of component state:

```jsx
export default connect((state) => state)(({ dispatch, isExpanded }) => (
	<HybridExpander
		isExpanded={isExpanded}
		onToggle={() => dispatch({ type: 'TOGGLE_EXPANDER' })}
		header='Stateless Usage'
		content='Explicitly pass in isExpanded to take control of that piece of state.'
	/>
));
```
