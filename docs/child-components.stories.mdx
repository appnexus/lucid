# Child Components

When we define a component type as a static property on another component, we refer to it as a _child component_.

## What are they?

Child component are like _sub-components_ that can be composed into the main component in this style:

```jsx
import SingleSelect from 'lucid-ui/SingleSelect';
const { Option, Placeholder } = SingleSelect;

<SingleSelect>
  <Placeholder>Choose a color</Placeholder>
  <Option>Red</Option>
  <Option>Green</Option>
  <Option>Blue</Option>
<SingleSelect>
```

## Why use them?

Rather than use the composition pattern above, we could have alternatively defined a component API that accepts props like this:

```jsx
import SingleSelect from 'lucid-ui/SingleSelect';

<SingleSelect
	placeholder='Choose a color'
	options={['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']}
/>;
```

This API is flat, clean and straightforward, but how does it handle edge cases?
Intuitively, you might think `placeholder` can only accept a string, and `options` accepts an array of strings.
But strings aren't the only things that can rendered.
Depending on the implementation of `SingleSelect`, `placeholder` and `options` could also accept `PropTypes.node` to allow:

```jsx
<SingleSelect
	placeholder={
		<span>
			Choose a color <CircleIcon />
		</span>
	}
	options={[
		<span>
			Red <RedCircle />
		</span>,
		<span>
			Green <GreenCircle />
		</span>,
		<span>
			Blue <BlueCircle />
		</span>,
	]}
/>
```

So now we can render any arbitrary element inside each option or placeholder.
But what if we wanted apply other props or styles to the containers of those arbitrary elements?
We could create a new prop for `placeholderProps` like this:

```jsx
<SingleSelect
	placeholder={
		<span>
			Choose a color <CircleIcon />
		</span>
	}
	placeholderProps={{
		style: { background: 'grey' },
	}}
	options={[
		<span>
			Red <RedCircle />
		</span>,
		<span>
			Green <GreenCircle />
		</span>,
		<span>
			Blue <BlueCircle />
		</span>,
	]}
/>
```

This allows additional props to be spread onto the container of the placeholder. For the array of `options` we can have it accept an array of props objects:

```jsx
<SingleSelect
	placeholder={
		<span>
			Choose a color <CircleIcon />
		</span>
	}
	options={[
		{
			style: { background: 'red' },
			children: (
				<span>
					Red <RedCircle />
				</span>
			),
		},
		{
			style: { background: 'green' },
			children: (
				<span>
					Green <GreenCircle />
				</span>
			),
		},
		{
			style: { background: 'blue' },
			children: (
				<span>
					Blue <BlueCircle />
				</span>
			),
		},
	]}
/>
```

You can see how this component API can become more complex to accommodate all the various edge cases.
This requires a more complex implementation as well as more documentation to enumerate all the special cases.

This is why we recommend using child components which by default already handle these variations with a consistent, composable component API:

```jsx
<SingleSelect>
  <Placeholder style={{ background: 'gray' }}>
    Choose a color <GrayCircleIcon />
  </Placeholder>
  <Option style={{ background: 'red' }}>Red <RedCircle /></Option>
  <Option style={{ background: 'green' }}>Green <GreenCircle /></Option>
  <Option style={{ background: 'blue' }}>Blue <BlueCircle /></Option>
<SingleSelect>
```

However, some still prefer to pass these nodes as props instead of using child components.
For the sake of consistency, we expose props with the same name as the child components which accept the various values you might expect to pass in:

```jsx
<SingleSelect Placeholder='Choose a color' Option={['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']} />
```

When you are using props API the prop value gets transformed to a child component that will be applied to the main component.

Here's how various prop values are transformed:

### String

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Placeholder="Choose a color"
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Placeholder>Choose a color</Placeholder>
</SingleSelect>
```

### Element

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Placeholder={
    <span>Choose a color <GrayCircleIcon /></span>
  }
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Placeholder>
    <span>Choose a color <GrayCircleIcon /></span>
  </Placeholder>
</SingleSelect>
```

### Object

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Placeholder={{
    style: { background: 'gray' }
    children: 'Choose a color',
  }}
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Placeholder style={{ background: 'gray' }}>
    Choose a color
  </Placeholder>
</SingleSelect>
```

### Array of strings

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Option={[
    'Red',
    'Green',
    'Blue',
  ]}
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Option>Red</Option>
  <Option>Green</Option>
  <Option>Blue</Option>
</SingleSelect>
```

### Array of elements

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Option={[
    <span>Red <RedCircle /></span>,
    <span>Green <GreenCircle /></span>,
    <span>Blue <BlueCircle /></span>,
  ]}
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Option><span>Red <RedCircle /></span></Option>
  <Option><span>Green <GreenCircle /></span></Option>
  <Option><span>Blue <BlueCircle /></span></Option>
</SingleSelect>
```

### Array of objects

```jsx
<SingleSelect
  Option={[
    { style: {background: 'red'}, children: 'Red' }
    { style: {background: 'green'}, children: 'Green' }
    { style: {background: 'blue'}, children: 'Blue' }
  ]}
/>

// is equivalent to:

<SingleSelect>
  <Option style={{background: 'red'}}>Red</Option>
  <Option style={{background: 'green'}}>Green</Option>
  <Option style={{background: 'blue'}}>Blue</Option>
</SingleSelect>
```

## How to create a child component?

A child component is just another way to pass data to the component.

You can inspect `props.children` to look for a matching child component to
reference its props and children that will be used in the main component's
render function:

```jsx
const Confirmation = ({ children, onSubmit, onCancel }) => {
	// default element;
	let submitButton = (
		<Confirmation.SubmitButton>Submit</Confirmation.SubmitButton>
	);

	// overwrite the default submitButton if one is found in props.children
	React.Children.forEach(children, (element) => {
		if (element.type === Confirmation.SubmitButton) {
			submitButton = element;
		}
	});

	return (
		<div>
			<section>{children}</section>

			<button onClick={onSubmit} {...submitButton.props} />
			<button onClick={onCancel}>Cancel</button>
		</div>
	);
};

// Child component renders null since we only use it to pass props to the real
// submit button and we don't want it to render anything in the content section.

Confirmation.SubmitButton = () => null;
```

In this example, the child component `Confirmation.SubmitButton` is just a noop.
That's because we only want to use it to pass in data through children.
Because we can inspect the props that it was passed in with, we can use them to render the real submit button with the added properties:

```jsx
<Confirmation>
	Would you like to continue?
	<Confirmation.SubmitButton style={{ background: 'green' }}>
		OK
	</Confirmation.SubmitButton>
</Confirmation>
```

In Lucid, we have the helper function `findTypes` to pull out the child component elements from props and children:

```jsx
import { componentTypes } from 'lucid-ui';
const { findTypes } = componentTypes;

const Confirmation = (props) => {
	const { children, onSubmit, onCancel } = props;

	const submitButton = findTypes(props, Confirmation.SubmitButton)[0] || (
		<Confirmation.SubmitButton>Submit</Confirmation.SubmitButton>
	);

	return (
		<div>
			<section>{children}</section>

			<button onClick={onSubmit} {...submitButton.props} />
			<button onClick={onCancel}>Cancel</button>
		</div>
	);
};

Confirmation.SubmitButton = () => null;

// tell findTypes to look for `props.SubmitButton`:
Confirmation.SubmitButton.propName = ['SubmitButton'];
```

The function `findTypes` checks the props objects for a prop that matches `propName`, then it checks props.children for elements which match the given component type.
Note that `findTypes` can be used to search for any component type, not just child components.
